# Redirect course format #

This course format redirects to courses that metalink the current one.
It is usefull when you want to fuse various courses into one.
Previously, the original courses need to be hidden from students.
With this format the original courses can be visible and browsable avoiding student confussion.

Current implementation only redirects to courses that have metalinked to this course.
More redirection conditions may be implemented in the future.
